In order to provide the illusion that a process has the whole machine to its own. OS needs to virtualize the physical resources in order to provide this illusion to the processes.

# The Abstraction: The Process

**Process**: A **running program**, can be described by its state.

**Machine State**: what a program can read or update when it is running. At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution of this program?

The **machine state** of a process:

1. Memory (address space)
1. Registers (program counter, stack pointer, frame pointer, etc.)
1. I/O

The program itself is a lifeless thing: it just sits there on the disk, a bunch of instructions (and maybe some static data), waiting to spring into action. It is the OS that takes these bytes and gets them running, transforming the program into something useful.

A **process list** contains information about all processes in the system. Each entry is found in what is sometimes called a **process control block (PCB)**, which is really just a structure that contains information about a specific process.
